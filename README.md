<h1 align="center">GeoBoss - Bird's Eye Distance Guessing Game</h1>


GeoBoss is an engaging front-end and back-end web application that challenges players to guess the bird's eye distance between two French cities. The game is based on APIs datas from INSEE (Institut national de la statistique et des √©tudes √©conomiques) and provides an entertaining way to test your geographical knowledge. The application is coded in React and styled using Tailwind CSS.

- Distance Estimation: Players must input their estimate of the bird's eye distance between the two selected cities.
- Score Tracking: The game keeps track of the player's score based on the accuracy of their guesses.
